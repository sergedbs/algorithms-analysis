## ðŸ“– **Course Overview**

The course provides an in-depth study of **algorithm development, analysis, and optimization**. It includes both **theoretical foundations** and **practical implementations**, covering:

- Algorithm complexity analysis
- Recursion and recursive algorithms
- Divide and Conquer techniques
- Greedy algorithms
- Dynamic programming
- Backtracking
- Genetic algorithms

The main goal is to **develop skills in selecting, designing, and analyzing algorithms** to solve computational problems efficiently.
