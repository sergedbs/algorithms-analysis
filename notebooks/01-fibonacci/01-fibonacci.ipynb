    "### **4.2 Performance Measurement**\n",
    "\n",
    "To accurately measure the performance of each Fibonacci algorithm, the following steps are taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Execution Time Measurement**:\n",
    "   - The execution time for each method is measured using Pythonâs `time` module.\n",
    "   - The `time.perf_counter_ns()` function is used to capture the start and end times in nanoseconds for high precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Warm-up Runs**:\n",
    "   - Each method is executed a few times (default is 3) before the actual measurement to ensure that any initial setup overhead is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiple Trials**:\n",
    "   - Each method is tested multiple times (default is 10 trials) to obtain a reliable average execution time.\n",
    "   - The results from these trials are collected and analyzed to filter out any outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Outlier Filtering**:\n",
    "   - Modified Z-scores and Interquartile Range (IQR) methods are used to identify and remove outliers from the collected execution times.\n",
    "   - This ensures that the reported execution times are not skewed by anomalous measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Result Storage**:\n",
    "   - The execution times are stored in a structured table using the `pandas` library.\n",
    "   - This allows for easy manipulation and analysis of the results.\n",

    "## **6. Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "This study empirically analyzed eight different algorithms for computing the Fibonacci sequence and compared their performance characteristics. The key findings and recommendations based on the results are summarized below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6.1 Key Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "The empirical analysis of Fibonacci computation methods highlights significant performance variations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ð **Recursive Approach**: Highly inefficient due to exponential time complexity $O(2^n)$, making it impractical for large $n$.\n",
    "- ð  **Memoization & Iterative DP**: Both offer linear time complexity $O(n)$ and effectively reduce redundant calculations, making them suitable for moderate input sizes.\n",
    "- â¡ **Matrix Exponentiation**: The most efficient method for large $n$, achieving logarithmic complexity $O(\\log n)$.\n",
    "- ð¢ **Binetâs Formula**: The fastest method in theory but unreliable for large $n$ due to floating-point precision errors.\n",
    "- ð¯ **Optimized Iterative Approach $O(1)$ Space**: Provides a balance between speed and memory efficiency, making it a practical choice for real-world applications.\n",
    "- ð **Fast Doubling Method**: Achieves logarithmic time complexity $O(\\log n)$, making it highly efficient for large $n$.\n",

    "| **Use Case**                   | **Recommended Algorithm**              | **Rationale**                                        |\n",
    "|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Small $(n \\leq 30)$**        | Recursive (for learning purposes)      | Simple and educational, but inefficient              |\n",
    "| **Moderate $(n < 10^5)$**      | Memoization (Top-Down DP)              | Eliminates redundant computations, runs in $O(n)$    |\n",
    "| **Large $(n < 10^6)$**         | Iterative DP or Optimized Iterative    | Efficient, avoids recursion overhead                 |\n",
    "| **Very Large $(n > 10^6)$**    | Matrix Exponentiation or Fast Doubling | Fastest for extremely large $n$, runs in $O(\\log n)$ |\n",

    "\n",
    "This study underscores the importance of **choosing the right algorithm based on problem constraints**. While **recursive methods** are useful for learning, they become impractical for large input sizes. **Memoization and Iterative DP** improve efficiency but remain **linear in complexity**. **Matrix Exponentiation** and **Fast Doubling** provide the best trade-off between speed and scalability for extremely large numbers.\n",
